I started playing and writing about my experiences with random games for several reasons:
- To improve my writing skills
- To build a [video archive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcEHSYxYdAXJQbH6LRqhSBPELvIZN2QXq) of obscure games that few have documented
- To broaden my perspective on game design by playing a variety of games
- To have an excuse to play more games instead of just replaying the same ones in a nostalgia-spiral



First, I created a program that randomly selects a game from a [large database](https://www.mobygames.com/).
I'll play the game long enough to experience the main gameplay loop and potentially longer if I get hooked.
Afterwards, I'll write about my experience and move on to the next game!
