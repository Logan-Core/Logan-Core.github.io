For a couple of years now, I’ve been in the habit of replaying the same games from my childhood on repeat.
The Core Game Database is my excuse to play a variety of new games. I created a program that will randomly select games from a large videogame database
I’ll then play each game long enough to get to the main game loop and write about it to help broaden my perspective on game design.
