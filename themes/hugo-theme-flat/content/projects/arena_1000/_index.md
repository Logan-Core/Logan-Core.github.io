## **What is this game about?**

[placeholder_name] is a Single player First-Person bullet hell game which tasks the player with one goal:

Survive the onslaught of enemies long enough until the path to the next level is opened.

Enemies will come out in waves which the player will need to deal with before the next wave spawns, stacking with enemies still present from previous waves which can quickly snowball into a chaotic mess.

There will be 9 total levels, each representing a layer of hell from Dante's inferno literature.
1. [Limbo](./level_1)
2. [Lust](./level_2)
3. [Gluttony - Cerberus](./level_3)
4. [Greed](./level_4)
5. [Anger](./level_5)
6. [Heresy - The Heretic](./level_6)
7. [Violence](./level_7)
8. [Fraud](./level_8)
9. [Treachery - Final Boss](./level_9)

It should be noted that the game itself won't have a story, just planning on borrowing from Dante's Inferno for imagery and inspiration. Astute observers may notice the references but that's about it.

Instead of a traditional scoring system, [placeholder_name] will have a timer that counts up which can be incremented both by staying alive and by activating more waves early by shooting the Bell that rests above each level

Each level will have a set time limit you must survive which isn't affected by calling in more waves early. I.E (The level is 120 seconds long and you call in more waves early by shooting the bell, speeding up the timer and getting more points, the level will still take a full 120 seconds to complete)

After the level timer timeouts, all enemies will stop spawning and the music and scenery and adjust slightly to signify to the player that the round is complete. The score timer will pause and after the player finishes up clearing the enemies that are left standing, a hole will open up in the center of the level and the bell will fall through. At the player's leisure, they can jump into the hole and follow the bell to the next level.

## **GameModes**
There will be two gamemodes for the player to choose from:

# Play:
The standard mode that starts the player from the beginning allowing the player to progress to new levels.
# Practice:
Allows the player to start from any of the floors they've reached before on previous playthroughs and select starting weapon resources.
After the player finishes a level in practice mode, the level transition hole that opens up will take the player to the same level on repeat until they switch back to Play mode.
