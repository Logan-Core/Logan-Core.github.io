## **What is this game about?**

[placeholder_name] is a Single player First-Person bullet hell game which tasks the player with one goal:

Survive the onslaught of enemies long enough until the path to the next level is opened.

Enemies will come out in waves which the player will need to deal with before the next wave spawns, stacking with enemies still present from previous waves which can quickly snowball into a chaotic mess.

There will be 9 total levels, each representing a layer of hell from Dante's inferno literature.
1. Limbo
2. Lust
3. Gluttony - Cerberus Boss
4. Greed
5. Anger
6. Heresy - The Heretic
7. Violence
8. Fraud
9. Treachery - Final Boss

It should be noted that the game itself won't have a story, just planning on borrowing from Dante for imagery and inspiration. Astute observers may noticed the references but that's about it.

Instead of a traditional scoring system, [placeholder_name] will have a timer that counts up which can be incremented both by staying alive and by activating more waves early by
shooting the Bell that rests above each level
