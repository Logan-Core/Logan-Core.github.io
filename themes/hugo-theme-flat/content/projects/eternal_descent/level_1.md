## *Limbo*
The first level in the game has a very important role to fill. The player will spend MOST of the time here.

Both beginners who are learning how to play and get used to the controls, and experts who are going for high scores and reset for the smallest mistakes.

The level needs to have a certain visually appeal that's candy for the eyes yet not be overstimulating to the point that makes players not want to see it potentially 100's of times.

The level will have distant grey clouds surrounding the outer rim of the visible background reminiscence of a stormy day and there will be a small section direction above the player which will have a hint of the sun and blue sky peeking through.
