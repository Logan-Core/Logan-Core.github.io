## *Gluttony - Cerberus*
The third level in the game will have the first boss the player encounters.

## Level Scenery
A super large cave expanse so large the walls can bearly be seen through distant fog. with giant stalactites/rock columns obscuring vision closer to the arena.
When Cerberus appears, parts of his moving snake body should appear off int eh distance coiling up and around the environment to give him an impossibly large sense of scale compared to previous enemies the player has encountered.

## **Cerberus**
There are certain rules that are typically followed for the "first boss" in an action video game. It is not untypical for the first boss to be treated as a glorified tutorial, however, that need not be the case for this guy. I want Cerberus to 100% be the first major wall the player has to overcome.

Intro:
The player drops into the arena from the previous level and the Catalyst floats quietly above the edge of the platform. Rumbling sounds are played and Cerberus's body begins to appear from the outskirts in the distance. A few moments later, a large creature with the body of a snake jets up to the left of the Catalyst, then a second on the right, and finally a third one jets up higher than the others directly behind the catalyst and chomps down on it, A vertical slit eyeball pupil appears on the catalyst and then the figth begins

Player Objective:
Attack the Catalyst inside Cerberus's mouth. The creature holding the Catalyst will occasionally back away into the abyss and send out enemies for the player to deal with.
The other 2 Cerberus heads will navigate semi-randomly around the arena and unleash simple attacks, the player will have the attention and focus split between different enemies in all directions at worse
