TABLE OF LENSES:
## 1 Emotion
- What emotions/feelings do I want the player to experience?:
	- Intense euphoria of having accomplished something they didn't even know they were capable of.
	- The game is difficult. however, those that stick to it long enough will have no choice but to learn it and get better. Holding that victory away from them until **they** rise to challenge is something many games don't do anymore and I'd like myself and others to experience.
- How can I bridge the gap between between the emotions/feelings the player is actually having and the emotions/feelings I'd like them to have?:
	- I can't account for all possible initial-skill levels of players but I should be able get enough statistics from playtesters to fine-tune the balance of each level so that the majority of players are engaged just the right amount.
## 2 Essential Experience
- What is essential to the experience?:
	- Near-perfect invisible appeal across the entire game. Too many games from people in my position just play and feel "cheap" and ungenuine. That's clearly not the truth, people wouldn't spend the 1000's of hours bringing these games to reality if they didn't believe in it themselves but that doesn't excuse the fact that time/energy gets put in the wrong things and major game decisions are made haphazardly and without consideration about how it'll affect the experience of the actual player. I want to avoid that at all cost and will have to nurture the game and introspect my own thoughts and feelings about the state of the game from the first steps to the moment it's released out in the world
## 3 Venue
- What venue do I expect the player to be in while playing?:
	- Almost exclusively privately at a desk. No controller support removes the ability to take the game on the go and even if it did, it wouldn't make a great fit. Mouse and keyboard are relistically the only way to play the game and that'll force the venue to be sitting down at the desk.
- Does the venue have special properties that'll influence the game?:
	- The player will likely have privacy, which will synergize with the absolute requirement of dedicated focus and attention. The inverse is true, however, and would make having real-life spectators difficult, but that shouldn't affect most people obviously.
## 4 Surprise
- What will surprise players when the play the game?
	- Some of the stuff I imagine the player would be surprised about will be on the store page / marketing and players will know about it before hand. So instead I'd say the the simple elegance of the player's gun. They'll be stuck with it for the game and I believe they'll be surprised with all the things you can do it with just the muzzle-switching mechanic
## 5 Fun
- What parts of the game are fun?
	- The high-risk/high-reward game loop. Players will always be under immediate threat of dying and needing to restart. There will be some fun synergy of keeping the enemies under control and focusing damage on the Catalyst.
- What parts need to be more fun?
	- The "busy-work" of returning to the later levels after dying. Players losing 10+ minutes of progress is not ok. I still want that to happen but I need to find some way of making the process of getting there more fun even if the player is frustrated
## 6 Curiosity
- What questions are put into the player's mind?:
	- The idea of reaching the bottom surely. It'll be difficult and players will have to work for it. But, universally every player will wonder about what's coming up next and what'll happen when they reach there.
	- The gun will change dramatically between upgrades, the player will like feeling more powerful and each upgrade they acquire will uniquely make them more so. They'll wonder what's next and the final upgrade on Level 9 should blow their minds.
